Affiliate Flow — Recommendation

Based on: SaaS Affiliate Marketing Proposal (HubSpot, Shopify, Canva, ConvertKit, Notion). Platform: Tolt (Basic Plan).


Benchmarks & what this means for us

Commission
Benchmark: 15–30% recurring common; 20–25% or 30% (Notion, ConvertKit) typical.
Recommendation: 30% recurring.
What this means for us: Strong, top-of-market offer; aligns affiliate incentive with retention.

Payout schedule
Benchmark: NET-30 most common; NET-15/60 also used.
Recommendation: NET-30.
What this means for us: Industry standard; gives refund/chargeback buffer before we pay. Tolt supports NET-15, NET-30, NET-60 — we choose in program settings.

Minimum payout
Benchmark: $50–$100 typical; some programs $25 or none.
Tolt: No platform minimum — we set it (can be $0).
Recommendation: $50 minimum.
What this means for us: Fewer small payouts and admin; still low barrier. We can lower to $25 later if we want to be more affiliate-friendly.

Payment methods
Benchmark: PayPal primary; bank/ACH, Wise for international.
Tolt (Basic): PayPal, Wise, local bank, wire; crypto manual only.
Recommendation: PayPal primary; Wise for international.
What this means for us: Use what Tolt offers; no extra gateway needed.

Payout execution (Tolt Basic)
Basic plan: Payouts are manual — we generate/run them in Tolt; auto payouts are on Growth/Pro.
What this means for us: Run payouts on our chosen schedule (e.g. monthly after NET-30); upgrade later if we want full automation.
