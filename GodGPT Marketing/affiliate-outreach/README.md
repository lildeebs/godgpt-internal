## Customization Checklist

- [ ] Personalize opening line based on specific content you've seen
- [ ] Review for tone alignment with creator's brand
- [ ] Check that all placeholders are filled

### For DM Outreach:
- [ ] Replace `[Creator Name]` with actual creator name (or use their handle)
- [ ] Add specific detail about their content (if using first version)
- [ ] Choose the version that matches their brand voice
- [ ] Keep it short - DMs should be concise
- [ ] Consider their timezone for best response times

## Best Practices

### Email Outreach:
1. **Personalization is Key**: Always reference specific content you've seen
2. **Authenticity Matters**: Match the tone to the creator's brand
3. **Value First**: Lead with what they get, not what you want
4. **Follow Up**: If no response in 1 week, send a gentle follow-up
5. **Track Responses**: Keep notes on which creators respond and what resonates

### DM Outreach:
1. **Keep it Short**: DMs should be 2-3 sentences max
2. **Be Casual but Professional**: Match the platform's casual tone
3. **Reference Their Content**: Show you've actually watched/seen their work
4. **Don't Be Pushy**: This is exploratory - see if they're open first
5. **Follow Up Once**: If no response in 3-5 days, one gentle follow-up is okay
6. **Respect Boundaries**: If they don't respond, don't spam

## Next Steps

### After Email Outreach:
1. Wait 5-7 days for response
2. If no response, send a gentle follow-up
3. Track which creators respond and what works
4. Iterate based on response rates

### After DM Outreach:
1. Wait 3-5 days for response (DMs move faster)
2. If no response, one gentle follow-up is acceptable
3. If they're interested, move to email for more detailed discussion
4. If they're not interested, respect their decision and move on
5. Track which approach works best for different creator types
